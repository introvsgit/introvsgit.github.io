      <h1>Chapter 1: Basics</h1>
      This page contains the basics like operations, the order of operations, fractions as such.
      Since this website focuses more on algebra, this page is for a quick refresh.

    <div class="content">
      <h2>Adding</h2>
      Adding is the operation in which you increase the size of the number.
      But not literally. <br>
      Examples: <br>
      <div class="examples">
        3 + 5 = 8<br>
        75 + 63 = 138<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;7 564<br>
        + 2 319<br>
        = 9 883<br>
      </div>
      <h2>Subtracting</h2>
      Subtracting is the opposite of adding. It is the operation in which you
      decrease the size of a number. But not literally.<br>
      Examples: <br>
      <div class="examples">
        7 - 2 = 5<br>
        785 - 342 = 443<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;1 034<br>
        - &nbsp;&nbsp;378<br>
        = &nbsp;&nbsp;656<br>
      </div>
      <h2>Multiplying</h2>
      Multiplying is adding a number to itself multiple times. Pretty self-explanatory.<br>
      Examples: <br>
      <div class="examples">
        2 * 5 = 10<br>
        35 * 28 = 980<br>
        854 * 147 = 125,538<br>
      </div>
      <h2>Division</h2>
      Division is the operation where you split numbers into <i>x</i> groups.<br>
      Examples: <br>
      <div class="examples">
        88 / 4 = 22<br>
        1792 / 8 = 224<br>
        365 / 5 = 73<br>
      </div>
      <h2>Exponents</h2>
      Basically, it is just the operation of making a number multiply by itself <i>x</i> times.<br>
      Examples: <br>
      <div class="examples">
        5<sup>4</sup> = 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 3,125<br>
        7<sup>3</sup> = 7 * 7 * 7 = 343<br>
        10<sup>6</sup> = 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 = 1,000,000<br>
      </div>
      <h2>The Order of Operations</h2>
      <ul class="examples">
        <li>PEMDAS</li>
        This is the order that most people would use.
        It stands for Parentheses, Exponent, Multiplication, Division,
        Addition, and Subtraction. This is actually similar to BODMAS<br>
        <br>
        Example:<br><br>
        [7 * 2 + (8 - 6 / 3) + (6 - 2)<sup>2</sup>] / 6
        Firstly, you must do the parenthesis first. Remember to <u>always apply the PEMDAS.</u>
        In the first parenthesis, you must divide 6 by 3 before you subtract 8 from the quotient.<br> 
        = [7 * 2 + (8 - 2) + (6 - 2)<sup>2</sup>] / 6<br>
        <note>P.S.: You might notice that there are two brackets:
        the round brackets or what we call as parenthesis, and the square
        brackets. The square brackets are actually not needed. You can replace
        them with the normal parenthesis but these are in for sightreadability.</note><br>
        Then calcuate them.<br>
        = (7 * 2 + 6 + 4<sup>2</sup>) / 6<br>
        Next up is to calcuate the result of 4<sup>2</sup>, since it is next in the order.<br>
        = (7 * 2 + 6 + 16) / 6<br>
        The next step is to calcuate 7 * 2, with Multiplication in the next order.<br>
        = (14 + 6 + 16) / 6<br>
        The next steps are pretty straightforward.<br>
        = (20 + 16) / 6<br>
        = 36 / 6<br>
        = 6
        <br>
        <br>
      </ul>
